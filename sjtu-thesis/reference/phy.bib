  journal = {International Journal of Critical Infrastructure Protection},
  year = {2010},
  abstract = {Railways are an important critical infrastructure because they transport
	commodities and goods (freight rail) and people (passenger rail).
	Like other critical infrastructures, the railway infrastructure is
	complex and geographically dispersed and has become increasingly
	dependent on information and communications technology (ICT). Therefore,
	the mitigation of ICT vulnerabilities is essential for protecting
	the railway infrastructure. This paper focuses on the European high-speed
	railroad infrastructure, in which a wireless system based on the
	Global System for Mobile Communications for Railways (GSM-R) standard
	plays an important role in distributing signaling information to
	trains. The paper examines the GSM-R vulnerabilities due to wireless
	interference and describes an innovative monitoring system based
	on software-defined radio technology that is designed for the early
	detection of wireless interference.},
